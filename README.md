# Housing Price Prediction (IE7275 Data Mining)

## Project Overview
This project is part of the IE7275 Data Mining course and focuses on predicting housing prices based on various features and historical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide accurate predictions that can help potential buyers make informed decisions.

## Objectives
- **Data Analysis:** Perform extensive exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying patterns and correlations within the housing market data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Enhance model performance by engineering and selecting relevant features that impact housing prices.
- **Model Development:** Develop and train machine learning models to predict housing prices effectively.
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-Learn for building machine learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
